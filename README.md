# Mobility-Project

This project examined mobility data worldwide. The data, supplied by Apple, was drawn from Apple maps, and consists of requests for directions on the app for walking, transit, and driving. We collected over three months of data from over 300 cities and countries from around the world. 

The completed project mainly consists of an HTML page that shows drop-down menus that allow the user to bring up the country and transportation method of their choice, and a Javascript page that has the backend code for the graphs. 

### Prerequisites

* Google Chrome or another web browser
* Visual Studio Code

### Getting Started

* After downloading the repository, the web page and graphs will be hosted on your machine and be viewable.
